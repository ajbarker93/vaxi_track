# User guide for VaxiTrack

Here are the steps to follow when looking for a local vaccine:

* Go to VaxiTrack
* Click "Find a vaccine"
* Enter your postcode and email and age, click "Submit"
* Check your emails - you should have an email from us confirming your signup

* When a vaccination centre logs their spare doses, we will contact you (in decreasing age order)

* If we've found you a spare, we will email you to tell you where and at what time. It will always be within 10km of your postcode
* Attend your vaccine session and help in the fight against Covid-19

* We'll also let you know if we haven't been able to find you a vaccine. Please try again tomorrow, as vaccine centres log doses everyday
