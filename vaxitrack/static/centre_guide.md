# Vaccination Centre guide for using VaxiTrack

Here are the steps to follow when logging a vaccine:

Have you already signed up as a centre? If not:

* Go to VaxiTrack
* Click "Register as a centre"
* Enter your postcode, centre name and NHS email. Click "Submit"
* You will receive an email with a 6-digit login code. Use this code when logging vaccines

If you have signed up, and wish to log a spare vaccine, please:

* Go to VaxiTrack
* Click "Log spare vaccines"
* Enter your 6-digit centre ID, the number of vaccines, the type of vaccines and the time they are available. Click "Submit"

* We will assign the spare doses to patients within a 10km radius of your centre, in decreasing age order
* We'll email you to let you know when we've done this and list the email addresses of the patients
